The redesign methodology focuses on transforming LinkedIn's interface by addressing usability issues and enhancing visual hierarchy. It begins with identifying core user problems through heuristic evaluation and user feedback. Based on this, wireframes and prototypes are created to improve clarity, accessibility, and engagement. The new design simplifies navigation, increases whitespace for readability, and modernizes aesthetics while preserving brand identity. Key changes include a cleaner layout, intuitive iconography, and a better-organized feed. 
This iterative process ensures user-centric decisions backed by research and testing. Overall, the redesign aims to boost usability, reduce cognitive load, and create a seamless, more enjoyable user experience.
